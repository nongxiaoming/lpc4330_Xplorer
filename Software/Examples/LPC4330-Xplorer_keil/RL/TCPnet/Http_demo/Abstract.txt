This is a HTTP Server example. It shows you how to use the
Web Server CGI interface as well. 

Use this example to connect LPC4330-Xplorer Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect LPC4330-Xplorer Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.101

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

The WEB pages are included into the project under HTTP Files 
group. You can simply add or remove a page or image. Web files
which are compiled into the project are added to the 'Web.inp'
Web Converter input file.

To test this example, open your web browser and enter the 
address http://lpc4330-xplorer/ or http://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

You can change the password at runtime on page 'system'

The HTTP_demo example is available for several targets:

LPC4330 SPIFI:
    Standalone (no RTX Kernel) application.
    Program code is loaded into external SPIFI flash.

LPC4330 Debug:
    Standalone (no RTX Kernel) with debug output.
    Program code is loaded into internal RAM.

    Debug level configured in Net_Debug.c configuration file.
    ITM channel 0 as a communication interface.
    start debug session (Ctrl + F5),
    open Debug (printf) Viewer and start code execution - press Run (F5).

MCB4300 RTX:
    The same example configured for RTX Kernel.
    Program code is loaded into external SPIFI flash.


Jumper settings:
  set jumper for boot pins to boot from SPIFI!
