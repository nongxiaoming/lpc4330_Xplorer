This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0                  = 480 MHz
   - PLL1                  = 180 MHz
   - CPU  clock = PLL1     = 180 MHz
   - USB0 clock = PLL0     = 480 MHz
   - USB1 clock = PLL1 / 3 =  60 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - ITM channel 0

The MSD_FILE program is an application adapted for 
NGX 'LPC4330-Xplorer' Board with 'NXP LPC4330 microcontroller', 
it is availabe for 2 targets:

  LPC4330 SPIFI:      configured for external SPIFI Flash
                     (used for production or target debugging)
                      Download application into target, start debug session (Ctrl + F5),
                      open Debug (printf) Viewer and start code execution - press Run (F5).


  LPC4330 RAM:       configured for on-chip RAM
                     (used for production or target debugging)
                     start debug session (Ctrl + F5),
                     open Debug (printf) Viewer and start code execution - press Run (F5).
