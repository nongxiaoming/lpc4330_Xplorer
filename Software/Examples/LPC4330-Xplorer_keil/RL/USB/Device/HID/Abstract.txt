The HID project is a demo program for the NGX 'LPC4330-Xplorer' Board 
using a NXP LPC4330  Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 2 LEDs
  - 1 BUTTON (SW2)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:

  LPC4330_USB0 SPIFI:     configured for external SPIFI Flash
                          (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC4330_USB0 RAM:       configured for on-chip RAM
                          (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC4330_USB1 SPIFI:     configured for external SPIFI Flash
                          (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC4330_USB1 RAM:       configured for on-chip RAM
                          (used for production or target debugging)
