The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the LPC4330
microcontroller using NGX 'LPC4330-Xplorer' Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL =           12.00 MHz
   - CPU  =          180.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LEDs are blinking with speed depending on SysTick timer interrupt period
 

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SWO Trace SPIFI:    runs from SPIFI Flash
                      shows use of ITM output, Exception Trace
					  use connector "Debug 10pin"

  SWO Trace RAM:      runs from internal RAM
                      shows use of ITM output, Exception Trace
					  use connector "Debug 10pin"
